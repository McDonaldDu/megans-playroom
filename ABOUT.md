# About project
Megan's Playroom is a basic level front-end development project which uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, along with other libraries.<br>
This project is an attempt of me to show off my skills as a frontend developer and is dedicated to my sister, Megan, who is autistic.<br>
The website is nothing special but mroe of aground for me to work on some javascript projects and game as well as some of sister's favorites<br>
which include 2048, chess, and more! I would like to give credit to Maksym Korzh who made the engine for the chess game featured on the website,<br>
check him out <a href="https://github.com/maksimKorzh">here</a>. I appreciate the support and insight from my friends and family while making this project <br>
and I am looking for genuine feedback on the website and what I can do to improve it. Currently I have spent about 5 hours developing this project so there <br>
is much more for me to improve on and am looking for some constructive criticism. feel free to message me! Thank you for checking this projcet out! <br>
